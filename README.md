# Customer Analytics and Purchase Analytics Project Overview

* Dividing a population of customers into groups that share similar characteristics using K-means clustering techniques combined with principal components analysis
* Grouping the customer by segments to gain insight into the purchase behavior

## Exploration Data Analysis


## Customer Analytics
Customer Analytics: The first part of the course focuses on how to perform customer segmentation, using a hands-on approach. It involves the application of hierarchical and flat clustering techniques for dividing customers into groups. It also features applying the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, as well as combining PCA and K-means for an even more professional customer segmentation.
### Customer segmentation
#### Data Standardization
#### Cluster Analysis (K-means)
#### Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

## Purchase Analytics
Purchase Analytics: The second part of the course explores both the descriptive and predictive analysis of the purchase behaviour of customers, including models for purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity. Not only that, but it also covers the application of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to make predictions using real-world data.
### Descriptive analysis

### Elasticity Modeling
#### Price Elasticity of Purchase Probability
#### Price Elasticity of Brand Choice Probability
#### Price Elasticity of Purchase Quantity
